# 🎓 Analysis of School Dropouts in Rural India

## 📊 Project Overview
The **Analysis of School Dropouts in Rural India** project aims to understand the **socioeconomic and demographic factors** influencing school dropouts in rural areas.  
A **synthetic dataset** was modeled and analyzed using **Python (Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib)** to identify patterns and predictors contributing to dropout rates, with a focus on **gender**, **income**, and **education level**.

## ⚙️ Key Features
- **Data Modeling:** Created a synthetic dataset capturing variables such as gender, income, age, education level, caste, and dropout status.  
- **Data Analysis:** Performed exploratory and statistical analyses to detect relationships between demographic factors and dropout behavior.  
- **Data Visualization:** Developed informative visualizations using **Matplotlib** to highlight high-risk groups and dropout trends.  
- **Insights & Impact:** Identified **gender** and **income** as major predictors of dropout likelihood, offering data-driven insights to guide **education policy interventions**.

## 🧠 Tools & Techniques
- **Python (Pandas, NumPy)** – Data cleaning, transformation, and statistical computation  
- **Matplotlib** – Visualizations and trend analysis  
- **Descriptive Statistics & Correlation Analysis** – To examine factor relationships and their strength

## 💡 Key Insights
- **Gender and Income** were the strongest predictors of dropout likelihood.  
- **Lower family income groups** showed significantly higher dropout rates.  
- **Girls** were more likely to drop out earlier compared to boys, often due to socio-cultural constraints.  
- The study emphasizes the need for **targeted educational support programs** in low-income, rural communities.
